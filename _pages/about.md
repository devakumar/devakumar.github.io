Welcome, I have a masters degree in Mechanical Engineering from EPFL, Lausanne [[1]](/assets/msdev.pdf) and bachelors in Aerospace Engineering from one of the top premier institutes in India, IIT Bombay [[2]](/assets/btdev.pdf).


I love rockets and engineering, and have been working with the Indian Space Research Organization since 2012. After six years of working for the design and successful testing of two of the "super cool" cryogenic rocket engines [[3]](https://www.inae.in/expert-profile-view/?cid=2862){:target="_blank"} [[4]](https://iafastro.directory/iac/paper/id/70925/summary/){:target="_blank"} [[5]](https://iafastro.directory/iac/paper/id/70945/summary/){:target="_blank"}, I  pursed masters degree with rigorous training on advanced control, optimization, robotics, machine learning and data science from Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (EPFL), Lausanne [[6]](/education/){:target="_blank"}.


My master thesis work on the "Development of a Multi-phase Optimal Control Software for Aerospace applications" resulted in a state-of-the-art open-source optimal control software called MPOPT [[7]](https://github.com/mpopt/mpopt){:target="_blank"} which solves almost any optimal control problem in the
standard Bolza form. During my thesis, I used the developed software to solve for the optimal trajectory for not only launching satellites to orbit, but also to return the booster stage to earth at the same time for reuse (ex. SpaceX falcon 9 Rocket) [[8]](https://mpopt.readthedocs.io/){:target="_blank"} [[9]](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=s9MYi38AAAAJ&hl=en&citsig=AMD79op8WpK06BipbEVqHJDaDbPiupN8YQ).


My professional interests are in the area of mathematical
modelling, numerical simulations, control and optimization of engineering systems. I love programming, motivated to work the intersection of optimal control, optimization, machine learning and software development to solve complex engineering challenges. I am passionate about sustainability, energy and climate change and the related research in the field of engineering towards making the world a better place for all.
