Welcome, I am an Aerospace Engineer 1,
love rockets and I have been working with the Indian Space Research Organization
since my graduation from the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay in the year 2012.
After six years of working for the design and testing of two of the "super cool" cryogenic rocket engines, I got myself a masters degree in Mechanical Engineering from the
Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Lausanne (EPFL) in the year 2020 with a
focus on controls and automation. My work on the Development of optimal control problem solver
software during the 6 months of master's thesis resulted in an open-source
software called MPOPT which solves almost any optimal control problem in the
standard Bolza form. My professional interests are in the area of mathematical
modeling, numerical simulation, control and optimization of engineering systems.
