Welcome, I have a masters degree in Mechanical Engineering from EPFL, Lausanne and bachelors in Aerospace Engineering from one of the top premier institutes in India, IIT Bombay.


I love rockets and engineering, and have been working with the Indian Space Research Organization since 2012. After six years of working for the design and successful testing of two of the "super cool" cryogenic rocket engines, I  pursed masters degree with rigorous training on advanced control, optimization, robotic, machine learning and data science from one of the best universities in the world, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (EPFL), Lausanne.


My master thesis work on the "Development of optimal control problem solver
software" resulted in a state-of-the-art open-source optimal control software called MPOPT which solves almost any optimal control problem in the
standard Bolza form. During my thesis, I used the developed software to solve for the optimal trajectory for not only launching satellites to orbit, but also to return the booster stage to earth for reuse (ex. SpaceX falcon 9 Rocket).


My professional interests are in the area of mathematical
modelling, numerical simulation, control and optimization of engineering systems. I would love to work at the intersection of optimal control, optimization, machine learning and software development to solve complex engineering challenges. I am passionate about sustainability, energy and climate change and the related research in the field of engineering towards making the world better for all.
